The "Study Buddy App" is a Flutter app using Firebase for anonymous sign-in and Firestore to store notes, summaries, quizzes, and attempts. Users enter study notes, get AI-powered summaries and quizzes via OpenAI API, take quizzes, and view past sessions. The UI covers login, notes, summaries, quizzes, and history.
